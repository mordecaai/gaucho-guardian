# This program will sort courses that made it through the filtering process using the user's preferences/information.

# Each course will be assigned a score out of 100, and we will initially display the top 5 according to how well they meet the user's criteria

# Idea: store user preferences in a dict and add keys to those dicts for the preferences the user has selected

# perhaps one of those keys will be the weights selected for each of the dicts, another dict

# write functions to calcualte score for each weight, then sum those all together to get a final score for each course

user_preferences = {}

#placeholder variables
